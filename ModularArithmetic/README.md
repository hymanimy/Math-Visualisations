Here is a folder containing the code for a mathematical visualisation of modular arithmetic tables. 

The code allows the user to generate and visualise a multiplication or addition table of the integers modulo n where n can be varied by the slider provided.

Each box which contains a number is coloured based on what number it is between 1 and n-1. 1 is blue, n-1 is red and everything else is a colour gradient in between. Zeroes are coloured white to show how tables modulo p (where p is prime) behave differently, as no numbers 1 < a,b < p will multiply to produce p.
